# About
I made simple web application with current covid-19 tracking. You can select there every country, see the most important data and even see chart with month increase.
<b>If you have '-1' values, try to use another web browser, because it's unable to get a data from API, because the site isn't HTTPS (error: ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID)</b>

## Building the app
For build the app, firstly download project with `git clone https://github.com/Xxsource98/COVID19-Track`. Later open terminal in your directory and use command `npm i` which will install all necessary modules. If everything will successfully download, just start application with `npm start`
